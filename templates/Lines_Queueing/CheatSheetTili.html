<h4>Basic ideas of the experiment</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In each round, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with several other participants. 
Each participant has three possible statuses: “waiting in the line”, “in service”, and “served”.  </li>
  <li>The round will be divided into several periods, where each period encompasses one player’s service turn. At the beginning of each round (the first period starts), 
      every participant is “waiting in the line” and they can start to exchange positions with the participants immediately next to them. </li>
  <li>You cannot interact with someone who is already interacting with the person in front of them; otherwise, you may initiate an interaction with said person. </li>
  <li>At the end of the first period, the first participant in the line will go to the service room, others remain in the line and the second period will start. 
The service for each participant will take one period (20 seconds) and the round ends when all participants have finished the service. </li>
</ul>


<h4>How your payoff is calculated</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Your payoff in each round will be given by <b> E + V - (n-1)*C + T </b>, where n is the order or place in which you are served.  </li>
  <li><b>E (Endowment)</b> is the value you have at the beginning of each period.  </li>
  <li><b>V (Value)</b> is the value of the service, which will be applied to a player’s point total only after they have finished their service turn. </li>
  <li><b>C (Cost)</b> is the time cost per period which will be deducted from a player’s point total after each period they participate in that does not send them to the service room.	
C will be determined randomly for each player in each period. </li>
  <li><b>T (trade)</b> is the sum of all transfers you receive minus all transfers you make from trading or exchanging places with others under some rules. </li>
</ul>


<h4>The rule you are currently playing: <b>Take/leave</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can send an offer to the person in front of you.   </li>
  <li>The requestee needs to either accept or decline your offer. If accepted, both of you exchange positions and you will transfer your offer to the requestee.    </li>
  <li>You may also receive an offer from participants directly behind you and you will need to respond to that offer.  </li>
</ul>
