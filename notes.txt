- divide ppl into subgroups
    - all subgroups wpuld have same number of people
- once they enter the room keep them in the room (for now) (cant trade back into line)

- trade dec have bids
bidding number decidied by player at start of round:
    when a person does a successful trade with the person in front of them, they lose (time gained * their b), and the person in front gains (time lost * requester's b)

b is range between 0 and their waiting cost
waiting screen has calculator to help people calculate b: waiting time * per unit cost

requesters can either give a bid or choose to not switch at beginning of round (before trading starts)

can only trade with adjacent people
if you have been requested a trade by person behind you and you click on request for the person in front of you:
    - cant do it

if someone says no to you, you cant request the same person again for 5 seconds. If a swith occurs in those 5 seconds, you can immediately request the new person in front of you

each person has different 'service_time':
rn assume each person takes same amount of time to go through when first in line
service time oes not reset when transfer refer

default: you nly know your own pay rate, and the bid when someone requests a trade with you
no message sallowed to be sent

if no response automatically no after some amount of time

round lengths: ottal of all waiting times

starting: everyone starts with random order at same time

- if you are first in the queue, and your time runs out before you have accepted or declined a request, you go through the door and the request resolves itself.

data
    waiting cost
    bidding price ($ or no)
    service time

    trades:
        timestamp
        IDs of traders
        bid price
        accepted or declined

ask kristian when he needs this done by, and whether i should prioritize this, rachels, or balance  

treatment: whether people can balk before
treatment: everyone sees everyone elses transfers

once you are in the room can you still see trading taking place? I assume yes, so the queue and service rooms are all one screen

have the group store a dictionary, mapping each player's ID to their participant.vars
